# Checkers

## About

I'm a QA Engineer turned Software Engineer refining my coding skills.  This project was just for fun, not meant for profit or procuring greatness (well, maybe just a little bit of greatness would be nice :) ).

I plan to add to this game over time.  The next definite thing is to extend the game into chess.  I will copy into a new repo so that this original checkers game can remain intact.  Other ideas that may or may not happen are to add online play, and/or put the game logic on a server (using Java or Ruby) - right now all game logic is client-side Typescript.

## References

The checker images were shamelessly stolen from: http://www.247checkers.com/.  Thank you!
