## Did you find a bug?

Please write up a bug report and I'll get to it as soon as possible.

## Want to add to the project?

At this time (2/14/18), I'd prefer no external contributions to this project.  This may change in the future.  I'm new to this dev stuff and I want something to showcase specifically what I know, and not what all you smarties out there may know.  Thanks for understanding.

However, feel free to clone it and tinker with it on your own to make it better.  I'm cool with that :)

## Have a question, comment?
